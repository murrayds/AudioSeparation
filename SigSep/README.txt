This project implements the algorithms defined by Paris Smaragdis. When used properly this code should allow
for the supervised and semi-supervised separation of signals from a mixture signal. See the class and function
files for in depth info on use.

Contents of this project include:
    SigSep.m
    plotBasisVectors.m
    separate.m
    signal2spec.m
    stft.m
    trainInterference.m
    trainInterference_Supervised.m
    trainInterference_SemiSupervisedFixed.m
    trainTarget.m

The contents of this project should function independant of all toolboxes not native to MATLAB
